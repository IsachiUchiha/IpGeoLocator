## Implemenation
 
The UI in IpGeoLocator is designed by using Qtdesigner ,which is a tool used to design UI components.
The output file created by Qtdesigner is .ui file .We need to convert this file into .py file,so that 
controller python code can import it properly.

The python framework used for showing  UI is pyqt .
